# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Bidirectional-LSTM

-- A Bidirectional RNN is a combination of two RNNs training the network in opposite directions, one from the beginning to the end of a sequence, and the other, from the end to the beginning of a sequence. It helps in analyzing the future events by not limiting the model's learning to past and present.
